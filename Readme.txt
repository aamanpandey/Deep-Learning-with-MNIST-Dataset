Deep Learning model for MNIST Dataset:

MNIST contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels, and centered to reduce preprocessing and get started quicker

The model achieve below accuracy:

test accuracy:     97.8% 
training accuracy: 98.92%
